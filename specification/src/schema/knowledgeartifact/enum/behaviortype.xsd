			<xs:enumeration value="SentenceGroup">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>A group of related alternative actions is a
						sentence group if the item referenced by the action is the same in
						all the actions, and each action simply constitutes a different
						variation on how to specify the details for that item. For
						example, two actions that could be in a SentenceGroup are
						"aspirin, 500 mg, 2 times per day" and "aspirin, 300 mg, 3 times
						per day". In both cases, aspirin is the item referenced by the
						action, and the two actions represent two different options for
						how aspirin might be ordered for the patient. Note that a
						SentenceGroup would almost always have an associated selection
						behavior of "AtMostOne", unless it's a required action, in which
						case, it would be "ExactlyOne".</xs:documentation>
