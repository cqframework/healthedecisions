    Model definitions are used to provide additional information about the data model used by an HeD Artifact to represent patient
    information. Specifically, the definitions provide key information for types defined within the model. Although XSD does have
    a mechanism for representing key information, doing so with XSD would also enforce the keys, and make any key attributes required
    in all contexts. Since we only need to know what constitutes the key properties for each type, we do not want the keys enforced,
    this definitions schema is used to provide that information.

    Evaluation services would use this information to construct an ObjectDescriptor element for use as part of the action sentences in
    actions returned as guidance by the CDS Service.
